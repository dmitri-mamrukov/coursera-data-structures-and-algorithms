        Computes equivalence classes of the partial cyclic shift.

        Theory:

            Let Ci be a partial cyclic shift of length L starting in position i.

            Ci can be equal to Cj, then they are in one equivalence class.

            This method computes class[i] number of different cyclic shifts of
            length L that are strictly smaller than Ci.

            Ci == Cj means that class[i] == class[j].

        Example:

            (See the introductory explanation in _sort_chars(word).)

            S = ababaa$

            order = [ 6, 0, 2, 4, 5, 1, 3 ]

            order char
            6     $
            0     a
            2     a
            4     a
            5     a
            1     b
            3     b

            Assign 0 to the smallest of the cyclic shifts of the current length.
            char = $ (position 6)
            class = [ _, _, _, _, _, _, 0 ]

            The next smallest cyclic shift is 'a', and it's different from the
            previous one ('$'). So we need a new equivalence class for 'a'.
            char = a (position 0)
            class = [ 1, _, _, _, _, _, 0 ]

            The next smallest cyclic shift is 'a', and it's the same as the
            previous one ('a'). So we assign 1 to it.
            char = a (position 2)
            class = [ 1, _, 1, _, _, _, 0 ]

            The next smallest cyclic shift is 'a', and it's the same as the
            previous one ('a'). So we assign 1 to it.
            char = a (position 4)
            class = [ 1, _, 1, _, 1, _, 0 ]

            The next smallest cyclic shift is 'a', and it's the same as the
            previous one ('a'). So we assign 1 to it.
            char = a (position 5)
            class = [ 1, _, 1, _, 1, 1, 0 ]

            The next smallest cyclic shift is 'b', and it's different from the
            previous one ('a'). So we need a new equivalence class for 'b'.
            char = b (position 1)
            class = [ 1, 2, 1, _, 1, 1, 0 ]

            The next smallest cyclic shift is 'b', and it's the same as the
            previous one ('b'). So we assign 1 to it.
            char = b (position 3)
            class = [ 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0 ]

            Now we know the classes of all the single character cyclic shifts.
            The $ is in equivalence class 0. The 4 a's are in equivalence
            class 1. The 2 b's are in equivalence class 2.

        Theory:

        Suppose we have a suffix array corresponding to an n-character text and
        we want to find all occurrences in the text of an m-character pattern.
        Since the suffixes are ordered, the easiest solution is to do binary
        search for the first and last occurrences of the pattern (if any) using
        O(log n) comparisons. Unfortunately, each comparison may take as much
        as O(m) time, since we may have to check all m characters of the
        pattern. So the total cost will be O(m log n) in the worst case.

        By storing additional information about the longest common prefix of
        regions of contiguous suffixes, it is possible to avoid having to
        re-examine every character in the pattern for every comparison,
        reducing the search cost to O(m + log n). With a sufficiently clever
        algorithm, this information can be computed in linear time, and can
        also be used to solve quickly such problems as finding the longest
        duplicate substrings, or most frequently occurring strings
        (GusfieldBook Â§7.14.4).

        Using binary search on the suffix array, most searching tasks are now
        easy:

            - Finding if a substring appears in the array uses binary search
            directly.

            - Finding all occurrences requires two binary searches, one for
            the first occurrence and one for the last. If we only want to count
            the occurrences and not return their positions, this takes
            O(m + log n) time. If we want to return their positions, it takes
            O(m + log n + k) time, where k is the number of times the pattern
            occurs.

            - Finding duplicate substrings of length m or more can be done by
            looking for adjacent entries in the array with long common prefixes,
            which takes O(mn) time in the worst case if done naively (and O(n)
            time if we have already computed longest common prefix information;
            see GusfieldBook).
